The program now supports args input from the command line, and checks to see if the specified file exists before
attempting to run the entire program.
If there are no dogs or cats in the file, the program will return a message indicating that there are no dogs or cats in the 
file.  Dogs and cats are checked independantly.
This program also checks if there are no people in the file, and returns a message saying that there are no people.
